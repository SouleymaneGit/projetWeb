# projetWeb

Our project aims to design a website dedicated to our "Algorithm of Graphs" course.

The site is not accessible online, it is necessary to launch it locally using django.

We recommend installing a virtual environment to avoid any problems.

Our virtual environment being too heavy we cannot transfer it, here is the list of what it contains:

decorator 4.3.0
Django 2.0.5
networkx 2.1
nose 1.3.7
numpy 1.14.3
pip 10.0.1
psycopg2 2.7.4
pytz 2018.4
PyYAML 3.12
scipy 1.1.0
setuptools 39.2.0
wheel 0.31.1
